# alix.sh

rewrite of kaedehara.xyz that will eventually become a new domain (when i buy it).

everything here is written in typescript/react with as little javascript as possible. <br> i use tailwindcss for most of the css. the website runs as an app using next.js

code might be very messy and some packages may not even be used at all, im just starting out with these frameworks/languages (literally started with zero knowledge prior 2/18/2023).
